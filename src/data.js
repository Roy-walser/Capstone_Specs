        question: "Why should I pressure wash my concrete?",
        answer: "Concrete is basically a sponge that soaks up the salts, oils, and other gunk from the street, and over time this can actually weaken and damage your concrete. "

        id: 2,
        question: "Why should I clean my trash cans?",

        id: 3,
        question: "How will pressure washing my driveway help with my curb appeal?",
        answer: "Washing will greatly improve the way your homes looks on the exterior, washing it and removing as much gunk as we can will bring back that light color of the concrete."

    {
        id: 4,
        question: "Will pressure washing remove all the stains?",
        answer: "Unfortunately we are not able to remove every stain. Concrete is a sponge and if not treated rather quickly then it is extremely hard to remove. Washing will remove the actual chemicals that harm the concrete."
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: "How often should I wash my concrete?",
        answer: "The best answer would be to do it every week, but we recommend doing it once before the winter and before summer."
